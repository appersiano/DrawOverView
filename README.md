# DrawOverView
## What
DrawOverView let the user draw with the finger/pen on the screen and share it.

## Why
I am currently working on an app that is checked by the customer. Usually we receive task related on something that is not correctly displayed and most of the time we don't not have a screen to understand what the customer mean.

So with DrawOverView funcionalities the customer can draw and let us know the exatcly wrong piece of UI and open directly a task with the screenshot attached (JIRA)

## Contribute
The custom view is very simple and missing a lot of features, if you want add something (like change the size of the line =) ) feeel free to fork and submit a pull request!
